### An Open-Source Toolkit for a Divestment Campaign

The state of Arkansas has committed **$157 million** of public money to Israel Bonds. This staggering sum includes **$57 million** at its peak from the State Treasury's portfolio and **$100 million** *authorized* for purchase by the state's two largest public pension systems: the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) and the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System (APERS).

This toolkit is the central, open-source resource for the **Divest for AR Future** campaign. We track these public investments, identify the officials responsible for them, and provide the tools you need to take direct action. Our goal is to empower citizens with verifiable data to demand financial transparency and advocate for the divestment of our public funds.

This is a living project, maintained by members of **Little Rock Peace for Palestine** and **Divest for AR Future**.
