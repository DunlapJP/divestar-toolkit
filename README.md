### ## 🎯 Our Goal

The state of Arkansas currently holds significant investments in Israel Bonds, using public funds—including state and teacher pensions—to financially support the state of Israel. This repository is a central hub for the research, data, and tools we are using to challenge and end this complicity. We believe in a future where our state's investments reflect our values of peace, justice, and human rights for all.

This toolkit is a living project, maintained by members of **Little Rock Peace for Palestine** and **Divest for AR Future**.
