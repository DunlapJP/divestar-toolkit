DivestAR Toolkit

An open-source toolkit for the Divest for AR Future campaign. This repository tracks Arkansas's public investments in Israel Bonds, provides contact information for decision-makers, and offers templates for direct action. Our goal is to empower activists and achieve financial transparency and divestment in Arkansas.
üéØ Our Goal

The state of Arkansas currently holds significant investments in Israel Bonds, using public funds‚Äîincluding state and teacher pensions‚Äîto financially support the state of Israel. This repository is a central hub for the research, data, and tools we are using to challenge and end this complicity. We believe in a future where our state's investments reflect our values of peace, justice, and human rights for all.

This toolkit is a living project, maintained by members of Little Rock Peace for Palestine and Divest for AR Future.
