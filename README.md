# divestar-toolkit
An open-source toolkit for the Divest for AR Future campaign. This repository tracks Arkansas's public investments in Israel Bonds, provides contact information for decision-makers, and offers templates for direct action. Our goal is to empower activists and achieve financial transparency and divestment in Arkansas.
