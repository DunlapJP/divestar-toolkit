### Email Body

Dear Members of the APERS Board of Trustees,

My name is **[Your Name]**, and I am a **[Your Role, e.g., a state employee, a retired county worker, a concerned Arkansas citizen]** from **[Your City, State]**.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the board's decision on June 11, 2025, to authorize an investment of up to \$50 million of our public employee retirement funds in bonds issued by the state of Israel.

Your primary fiduciary duty is to safeguard the retirement security of Arkansas's public employees. This investment unnecessarily exposes our pension funds to significant geopolitical and financial risks, especially given that major credit rating agencies like Moody's and S&P Global have recently downgraded Israel's credit outlook due to ongoing conflict.

I urge you to act in the best interest of Arkansas's public servants by rescinding this authorization and divesting from these high-risk foreign bonds. Our retirement security should not be tied to the volatility of a foreign war.

Thank you for your time and your service. I look forward to your response on this critical matter.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name]**
**[Your City, State]**
