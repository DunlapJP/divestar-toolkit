# Phone Script: Calling Pension Board Members

Making a phone call is one of the most impactful ways to make your voice heard. Board members are public officials, and it's their job to listen to the concerns of Arkansans.

This script is a guide. Use it to help you, but remember that speaking from the heart is always more powerful. Be firm, be respectful, and be clear.

### Before You Call

1.  **Know Who You're Calling:** Have the name of the board member you are calling from our **[ATRS](../key-officials/atrs-board-of-trustees.md)** or **[APERS](../key-officials/apers-board-of-trustees.md)** lists.
2.  **Know Your Goal:** Your goal is to register your opposition to the Israel Bonds investment and ask them to reconsider and divest.
3.  **Be Prepared to Leave a Voicemail:** You will likely speak to an assistant or get voicemail. That's okay! Leaving a clear message is just as effective.

### The Script

**You:** "Hello, my name is **[Your Name]**, and I'm a resident of **[Your City]**. I'm calling today to leave a message for **[Board Member's Name]** regarding the pension fund's investment in Israel Bonds."

*(Pause for the staffer to acknowledge you)*

**You:** "I am deeply concerned about the board's recent decision to authorize a \$50 million investment in these bonds. Given the recent credit downgrades of Israel by both Moody's and S&P, this seems like an unnecessarily risky use of our public pension funds."

**You:** "Exposing our state's retirement funds to the volatility of a foreign conflict is a breach of the board's fiduciary duty to protect the financial security of its members."

**You:** "I am asking **[Board Member's Name]** to publicly reconsider this decision and to vote to divest from Israel Bonds at the next opportunity."

**You:** "Could you please confirm that my message has been received and will be passed along to the board member?"

*(If leaving a voicemail, you can end with)*

**You:** "Again, my name is **[Your Name]** from **[Your City]**. Thank you for your time."

### Tips for a Successful Call

* **Be Polite:** The person on the other end of the line is likely a staffer. Being polite and respectful makes it more likely your message will be delivered accurately.
* **Be Brief:** Get right to the point. Your call should take less than two minutes.
* **Report Back (Optional):** Let your fellow activists know that you've made a call! It can encourage others to do the same.
