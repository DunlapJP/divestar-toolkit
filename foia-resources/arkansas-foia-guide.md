# A Beginner's Guide to the Arkansas FOIA

The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is one of the most powerful tools we have as citizens. It is based on the principle that "public business should be performed in an open and public manner." It grants you the legal right to inspect and copy public records from any state or local government agency.

This guide, based on the **2025 Arkansas FOIA Handbook**, will walk you through the basic steps to file your first request.

### The Law & Your Rights

The full text of the Arkansas FOIA can be found in the **Arkansas Code Annotated ยง 25-19-101 et seq.** For a comprehensive overview, you can reference the primary source for this guide: the **[2025 Arkansas FOIA Handbook, 21st Edition](../source-documents/2025-FOIA-Handbook-21st-Edition-ver4.pdf)**.

> **Key Principle:** The FOIA is designed to ensure that the public can observe the performance of public officials and the decisions made in public activity and policymaking.

### Who Can You Request Records From?

## How to File a Request: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Step 1: Be Specific About the Records You Need**

A vague request like "all emails about Israel" will likely be denied. A specific and targeted request is much more effective.

* **Vague:** "Everything on Israel bonds."
* **Specific:** "All email correspondence between the State Treasurer's office and the Development Corporation for Israel from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023."

#### **Step 2: Find the Right Person (The "Custodian of Records")**

Every agency has a designated person responsible for handling FOIA requests. You can usually find this person by looking for a "FOIA" or "Public Records" link on the agency's website. If you can't find a specific person, you can address your request to the head of the agency (e.g., the Executive Director or Communications Director).

#### **Step 3: Write Your Request**

Your request should be a simple, polite letter or email. It must include:

* A clear statement that you are making a request under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
* A specific description of the records you are seeking.
* Your name and contact information.

> **Important:** You do not need to state a reason for your request.

#### **Step 4: Send Your Request**

Email is the easiest and most effective way to send a request because it creates a clear paper trail.

#### **Step 5: Follow Up**

Under Arkansas law, the agency must respond to your request within **three (3) business days**.

* If they need more time, they must inform you in writing.
* If you don't hear back within three days, send a polite follow-up email to check on the status.

### Pro Tips for a Successful Request

* **Be Polite and Professional:** You are more likely to get a helpful and prompt response if you are courteous.
* **Keep a Record:** Save a copy of your request and all correspondence with the agency. This is crucial for accountability.
* **Know Your Rights on Fees:** An agency cannot charge you to *inspect* records. They can only charge reasonable fees for the actual cost of *copying* records.
* **Start Small:** If this is your first time, make your request simple and specific. As you gain experience, you can make more complex requests.

### What If Your Request is Denied?

If your request is denied, the agency must provide you with a written explanation citing the specific legal exemption that allows them to withhold the records. If you believe the denial is improper, you can challenge it.
