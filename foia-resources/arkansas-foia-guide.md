# A Beginner's Guide to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is one of the most powerful tools we have as citizens. It is based on the principle that "public business should be performed in an open and public manner." It grants you the legal right to inspect and copy public records from government bodies.

This guide, based on the **2025 Arkansas FOIA Handbook**, will walk you through the basic steps to file your first request.

### ## How to File a Request: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Step 1: Identify the Records You Need**

Be as specific as possible. A vague request like "all emails about Israel" will likely be denied. A specific request like "all email correspondence between the State Treasurer's office and the Development Corporation for Israel from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023" is much more effective.

#### **Step 2: Find the Right Person (The "Custodian of Records")**

Every agency has a designated person responsible for handling FOIA requests. You can usually find this person by looking for a "FOIA" or "Public Records" link on the agency's website. If you can't find a specific person, you can address your request to the head of the agency (e.g., the Executive Director or the Communications Director).

#### **Step 3: Write Your Request**

Your request should be a simple, polite letter or email. It must include:

* A clear statement that you are making a request under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
* A specific description of the records you are seeking.
* Your name and contact information.

**You do not need to state a reason for your request.**

#### **Step 4: Send Your Request**

Email is the easiest and most effective way to send a request because it creates a clear paper trail.

#### **Step 5: Follow Up**

Under Arkansas law, the agency must respond to your request within **three (3) business days**.

* If they need more time, they must inform you in writing.
* If you don't hear back within three days, send a polite follow-up email to check on the status.

### ## Tips for a Successful Request

* **Be Polite and Professional:** You are more likely to get a helpful response if you are courteous.
* **Keep a Record:** Save a copy of your request and all correspondence with the agency.
* **Know Your Rights:** An agency cannot charge you to *inspect* records. They can only charge reasonable fees for the cost of *copying* records.
* **Start Small:** Your first request should be simple and specific. As you get more experienced, you can make more complex requests.

### ## What If Your Request is Denied?

If your request is denied, the agency must provide you with a written explanation citing the specific legal exemption that allows them to withhold the records. If you believe the denial is improper, you can challenge it.
